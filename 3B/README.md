## The CRUD Operation ‚õ≥

 ***CRUD*** stands for **Create, Read, Update,and Delete**, which are the fundamental actions used for persistent storage and manipulation of data.

Here's a breakdown of how CRUD is implemented in my project:

**Create**: 
Users can be created by filling out the "Add User" form. When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the server, and a new user is created in the MongoDB database using Mongoose. The user's information, including their name, email, phone, and image, is stored in the database.

**Read**: 
The application allows users to view the existing users on the home page. When the page loads, a request is sent to the server to fetch all the user data from the database. The retrieved user data is then displayed on the home page, showing details such as name, email, phone, and image.

**Update**: 
Users can update their information by clicking the "Edit" button next to their entry on the home page. This action takes them to the edit user form, where they can modify their name, email, phone, or image. Upon submitting the form, the updated user data is sent to the server, and the corresponding user record in the database is updated using Mongoose.

**Delete**: 
To remove a user from the system, users can click the "Delete" button next to their entry on the home page. This triggers a request to the server, which then locates the user in the database based on their unique identifier (ID). The user record is then deleted using Mongoose, permanently removing the user from the database.

These CRUD operations allow users of my application to effectively manage user data, create new user entries, retrieve existing user information, update user details, and delete unwanted user records.
